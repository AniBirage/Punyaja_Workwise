## Problem Description:
- There are 80 seats in a train with only 7 seats in a row and the last row of only 3
seats. For simplicity, there is only one coach in this train.
- One person can reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
- If a person is reserving seats, the priority will be to book them in one row.
- If seats are not available in one row then the booking should be done in such a way
that the nearby seats are booked.
- Users can book as many tickets as s/he wants until the coach is full.
- User login and signup
- If one user books a seat, no other user can reserve that seat until the booking is
canceled or reset
